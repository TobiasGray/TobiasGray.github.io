        <p style="position:inherit; left:10%; right:15%; top:115%; font-size:x-large;">In the research phase of this project, I explored many topics and factors which influenced aerodynamics, aerospace and forces working with and against my rocket. I indulged into the world of nose cones, exploring elliptical, conic and tangent ogive options.The nose cone plays a critical role in the stability and aerodynamic forces revolving around my rocket. I learned that balancing thee factors between the parts of my rockets would maximize the heights it could fly. Consequently, fins are also equally important to any rocket. Fins provide stability while stationary, stability in flight, and controlling/heightened use of aerodynamic forces. I chose to go with the tapered swept fins, as they inclined to the side of stability to compensate for my nose cone choice.Some pertinent information I learned along the way included the following. The total maximum height of a wing should be half the size of the tube height itself. For instance, in the case of an elliptical wing, the diameter of the semicircle should be half of the tube size. My sketches tested variety, allowing me to gauge stability, aerodynamics, and drag as a whole element between fins and nose cone. I also considered both 3 and 4 fins, as a way to add more stability in-flight.</p>

        <p style="position:inherit; left:16%; right:15%; top:392%; font-size:x-large;">The rocket build took a majority of this project's length. It was also the most exciting part for me. I worked on designing, decorating and building my rocket's components. Some notable successes included the egg compartment. The compartment itself fits perfectly within the nose.Another success I observed with my compartment is closely linked to the dimensions; the relation to the nose cone. The nose cone I built circumvented to a point with shards on the inside and rings/hinges on the outside to form a tangent ogive. The outermost shell was made by elliptical indented flaps, pertaining to a center point. This is extremely relevant with my egg compartment. My egg compartment was essentially right behind this oddly shaped cone, meaning the lock on the nose-cone side was important for the wiggle room my egg got that could potentially break it. The dimensions worked out successfully, leaving just enough space on the other side of the compartment(in front of the bottle stopper) to place ultra-thin cotton pads that would cushion the high velocity speed of the rocket and egg compartment inside. An unsucessful part of the construction process was the rocket nose.  I decided that I wanted to build a tangent ogive nose cone.  The curve and aerodynamics make this cone a great balance for subsonic speeds, though speeds high enough to make certain other cones irrelevant. I originally began with triangular flaps as Iâ€™d seen in one video. This did not generate a curved middle/frustum, rather a more conic nose shape. I tried to optimize this with scoring, vinyl, and many rings of chipboard. Ultimately, I went back to research and grabbed inspiration from my peers to develop the elliptical flaps, producing a much more desirable result as shown above. </p>
