        <h1 style="position: inherit; left:500px; top:10px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;">Floor Plan</h1>
        <p style="position:inherit; left:445px; top:15%; right:30%; font-size:x-large">It took me 3 days to create the floor plan. I used floor plan symbols that are modernized to architecture today. My original room had dimensions: 28 ft x 22 ft x 12 ft. The intention of my dream space was to serve as a spacious, cozy and personalized place to live. My unique dream space contains a multi-purpose table and chairs in the patio with modern glass covering and stone flooring. Inside I have a bed, closet, simplistic living area and mini-kitchen, and a sushi conveyor belt. A combination of these amenities bring great utilities and personal favorites together for me. I have a desk for work, study, and where the genius ideas hatch. Altogether, my dream room makes a place where I could enjoy and love a career in Technology.

        <h1 style="position: inherit; left:500px; top:10px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;">Sushi Conveyor</h1>
        <p style="position:inherit; left:445px; top:15%; right:30%; font-size:x-large">I love sushi! The first time I stayed alone in a University campus, my fondest memories include buying sushi from the on-campus restaurant and staying up late. Researching installable sushi conveyors took the most time for me in my floor plan. I also spent a lot of time designing it on Tinkercad and in the build.</p>

        <h1 style="position: inherit; left:500px; top:10px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;">Bedside</h1>
        <p style="position:inherit; left:505px; top:15%; right:30%; font-size:x-large">Here is an image of the bedroom. Beside the bed I have a closet that is likely filled with chips ðŸ˜„. I also have a curve-cut desk for work, with my laptop and a rolling chair. For me, this part of the room is essential as it hints towards the purpose of this room. I think the main value in this room lies in the comfort and personalized environment which it provides, something I always wish for.</p>

    <div class="fourth">
        <img src="DreamSpace/Outbird.jpg" alt="Backyard Patio" style=" position: absolute; right: 2%; border: 6px double black;">
        <h1 style="position: inherit; left:500px; top:10px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;">Patio</h1>
        <p style="position:inherit; left:505px; top:15%; right:30%; font-size:x-large">"Not Wine, but Dine and Sunshine on the patio!" A patio accentuates any dream room for a person who does a lot of thinking. Connecting with the outdoors is something I value highly on my list. After a long day's hard work, or simply for a new view while eating my sushi, a patio for just me is the place I'd look every time. With a patio open to only myself, I could relax, reflect, and rejuvenate while doing important things like yoga, eating, and baking stress-free. My patio plays a big role in the mood of my dream room, so I designed the flooring seperately by printing a beautiful stone tiling. My chairs are uniquely lay-back and the table is height-adjustable! Every patio aspires to look like mine.</p>

        <img src="DreamSpace/Autodesk.jpg" alt="Autodesk Screenshot" style=" position: absolute; left: 2%; border: 6px double black;">
        <h1 style="position: inherit; left:500px; top:10px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: xx-large;">Tinkercad/Autodesk</h1>
        <p style="position:inherit; left:505px; top:15%; right:30%; font-size:x-large">The 3D Model is incredibly relevant in architecture and construction. I scaled my dimensions down to 12:1 inches. I chose these numbers to convert easily from feet to inches with a factor of 12. For example, a 6 foot bed would be drawn as 6 inches (cubes on the grid paper). This worked especially well because my largest dimensions, 28 feet, fit into the confines of tinkercad just perfectly.  I'd describe scaling each of the little pieces as the trickiest part of this project, so choosing an easy-to-work-with factor made my life a lot easier. I took builds online for things like doors, beds, chairs, and my desk. Although I experienced tremendous lag and lost my file once, I enjoyed working with this autodesk software. As the website says itself, "from mind to design in minutes!".</p>
